# Contact Keeper 

## Introduction
This is the second part of the React Front to Back course from Brad Traversy

The Project introduces the MERN setup, which is the MongoDB-Express-React-NodeJS setup

- MongoDB: Stores all information in Shards. Quite easy to use
- ExpressJS: API server. In this course we learnt how to call, with an authentication middleware
- ReactJS: The Frontend. Where the magic happens
- NodeJS: the server backbone

## Future enhancement
Since this is a base application, I might use this to further strengthen my core understanding in ReactJS.
